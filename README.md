# Oratio Webpage
Oratio was designed specifically for Stroke and Brain Injury patients to complement their rehabilitation and therapy. When stroke strikes a person can lose their ability to speak, move and eat this can be extremely frustrating but can usually be easily rectified with regular therapy and practice.

A gamified, rewarding experience will track the user’s performance, recovery rate and provide essential data to both the patient and the therapist/doctor.

Therapy works best when it’s carried out as often as possible and good practice usually means faster improvement. Oratio will help to motivate the user by closely monitoring their progress in a productive and fun way.
